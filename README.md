# Overview:

This was the first introductory project in Udacityâ€™s Data Analyst Nano Degree (DAND) program: Term 1.

In this project, we had to analyze local and global temperature data. We had to then compare the temperature trends where we lived to overall global temperature trends. A visualization and write up describing the similarities and differences were to accompany the code. Detailed instructions were provided along with the workspace to code. We had to include a PDF with an outline of steps taken to prepare and visualize the data, code and our observations of the trends.
Coding was in SQL for data extraction with records being exported into CSVs .
# Objectives:

+ Analyze local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends
+ Practice data extraction from database in SQL
+ Data manipulation in spreadsheet or tool of choice and Computing basic statistics
+ Creating Visualizations and interpreting them
+ Outlining observations and key considerations when deciding how to visualize the trends
